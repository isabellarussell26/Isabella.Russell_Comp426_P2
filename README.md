Programming Assignment #2


In my Squirrel game, the player is a squirrel png image that moves left, right, up and down 
with the arrows on the keyboard. When main.go is ran, it starts on level 1 (level1.tmx) file 
created on Tiled. I was unable to successfully find images of tiles that were all the same 
size, therefore I used the tiles provided to us on the classroom website. On the level there 
are fifteen randomly placed images of acorns. The acorns are the good items for the squirrel
to collect. There are 5 chocolate items placed randomly as well, the chocolate is the bad 
item. The score is in the top right corner of the game window. When the player collects 9 acorns
an arrow is present at the bottom right of the map. The arrow is the gate/door/portal to the 
next level that only appears when 9 acorns are successfully created. When one the squirrel collides
with any 1 chocolate, the game will end and the screen will say game over not allowing thr player
to continue unless relaunching the game. When entering level 2 (level2.tmx), the squirrel there 
are randomly placed acorns and chocolate again. The NPCs are two humans walking back and forth, 
left and right on the screen.

I unfortunetly, got stuck on my camera moving my sprite off of the map for longer than I would have 
liked to. I also allowed myself to get stuck on the process of making my NPCs continuously move back 
and forth on the screen of level 2. Since I let myself get wrapped up in multiple problems I was 
encountering, there were a couple of things I did not finish. My game never officially ends unless
the player touches chocolate, after  the squirrel goes to level 2, the player can go  to the 
gate and go to level 2 again. Although my player does not move off of the map, my squirrel is not 
animating for its movements left, right or up and down. I spent too much time trying to think of 
an idea, and then I spent too much time trying to find an image of the animated movement of a squirrel.
I asked Ai to make this for me, and it was not coming out in a way that it would work, which led me to be defeated.
Neither my player, or my NPCs animate while moving.
